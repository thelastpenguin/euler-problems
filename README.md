# euler-problems
In this repository I will be publishing my solutions to the euler problems as I progress through them.

Many solutions as you will easily see are not necessarily the optimal solutions but because of the nature of the C++ language and its compiler there is no need for optimization. I may return to problems and optimize them later.


I went through over the summer of 2015 and implemented the solutions to most of the first 20 solutions in C++. I have since been going through and rewriting or creating new solutions using haskell which has made many of the problems conceptually much simpler by functionalizing them but has also posed a number of interesting optimization challenges especially for euler problems that require a substantial amount of brute force.
